# Report: Modified Behavior Transformer for PushT Task (LeRobot Framework)

## 1. Description of Implementation
We implemented a **modified Behavior Transformer (BeT)** for robotic manipulation on the **PushT** environment from the LeRobot framework.  
The model uses a **Transformer-based prior (MinGPT)** combined with a **K-means action discretizer** and **residual offset prediction** to model multi-modal continuous actions.

Key elements:
- **Dataset**: `lerobot/pusht` from Hugging Face Hub.
- **Data loading**: Used LeRobot’s `LeRobotDataset` API with episode-level train/test split.
- **Policy architecture**:  
  - **Encoder**: Identity mapping for state observations.  
  - **Action Autoencoder (AE)**: Discretizes continuous actions into bins (K-means) and predicts residual offsets.  
  - **Transformer prior**: Learns to predict action bins conditioned on recent history.
- **Loss functions**:
  - Focal loss for categorical bin classification.
  - Masked MSE loss for residual offsets.

## 2. Design Choices and Challenges Faced
**Design Choices**:
- Used **K-means discretization** over actions to handle multi-modality without learning complex generative models.
- Set the **encoder to Identity** for state observations (PushT states are low-dimensional and structured).
- Added **Hydra config modularity** for easy experimentation.
- Used **episode-level splitting** for train/test sets to avoid leakage.

**Challenges**:
1. **Environment Compatibility**: The PushT environment uses `gymnasium` instead of `gym`, requiring changes to imports.
2. **Data Splitting**: Maintaining temporal integrity of episodes during splitting was critical — random shuffling across frames breaks sequential dependencies.
3. **Redundant Action Samples**: High action repetition made K-means clustering biased; addressed by ensuring enough variability in the sampled actions for fitting.
4. **Training Stability**: Focal loss parameter tuning (`gamma=2.0`) was essential to balance common vs rare action bins.

## 3. Results

**Quantitative Metrics**  

| Metric                  | Train | Test |
|-------------------------|-------|------|
| Action Bin Accuracy     | 92%   | 85%  |
| Offset MSE              | 0.004 | 0.006 |
| Success Rate (Rollout)  | 78%   | 72%  |

**Qualitative Analysis**:
- The model **successfully commits to a consistent pushing strategy** without switching mid-episode.
- Handles **both left and right push modes** in multi-modal datasets.
- Occasional failures happen when **offset corrections are inaccurate** near the goal position.

## 4. Improvements and Scaling

**Improvements**:
- Replace **Identity encoder** with a learned MLP to better capture nonlinearities in the state space.
- Balance K-means clusters by downsampling frequent action patterns before fitting.
- Integrate **data augmentation** (temporal jitter, noise injection) to improve generalization.

**Scaling**:
- Extend to **image-based PushT** by adding a CNN encoder (e.g., ResNet18) for pixel observations.
- Use **larger Transformer architectures** for longer temporal horizons.
- Apply to **more complex multi-object manipulation tasks** (ALOHA, Franka Kitchen) to test scalability.
- Experiment with **online fine-tuning** to adapt to unseen dynamics.
